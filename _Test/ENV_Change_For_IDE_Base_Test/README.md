what is this module what in earth dose it do :
- if you are a lazy ass like me you dont want to set up database on you machine and connect to the db of current container that is running this is the way 
- i recreated module for reconnecting to the db even if its on the same machine docker compose so you dont need to setup the db locally again just use this instead of the main method in the db i know its not perfect but i used it to debug on my id using the db of the docker compose
